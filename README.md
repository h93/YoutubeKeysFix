# Youtube key shortcuts FIX
This is a userscript for web browsers
- to fix inconsistent keyboard shortcuts of youtube,
- enable volume control by mousewheel scrolling over the player,
- make Tab-navigation more user-friendly by visualizing focus on player, video list items, comments with frame shadow.

[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) / [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (FireFox only)  addon enables your browser to use this and other userscripts.
When you have one of these addons installed you can install the userscript from one of the active userscript collecting sites:

### [Description](Description.md):
#### Youtube player controls will work consistently when player is focused:
- Left / Right (5sec backwards / forwards), Up / Down (volume up / down), Home (restart video), End (skip to end)
- 0-9 (jump to 0%-90%), C (switch closed captions/subtitles), +/- (change cc font size):  unaffected

#### Player is focused right after pageload, no need to click in player frame:
- Click outside player frame to get standard page controls: Up, Down, Left, Right (scroll)
- Press Esc to focus player, Shift-Esc to cycle search box, video list, like buttons / comments.
- Space pauses video on the whole webpage except textboxes.

#### Global shortcuts, changed:
- Esc (exit fullscreen):  additionally focuses player when not in fullscreen
- Space (play/pause):  works on whole page, not only when player is focused

#### Global shortcuts, unaffected:
- F (fullscreen), M (mute)
- K (play/pause)
- J / L (10sec backwards / forwards)
- , (previous frame), . (next frame)
- Shift-, (speed -0.25), Shift-. (speed +0.25)
- Shift-N (next video), Shift-P (previous video)
- / (focus searchfield, only in classic ui)
- ENTER (push the focused button)

#### Fixes the following awkward behaviour of Youtube player controls after clicking them (making the individual control focused):
- after clicking the mute button Space toggles mute instead of pausing
- after clicking the progressbar Up/Down will jump 10 sec in the video instead of changing the volume
- after clicking the volume slider Left/Right will change the volume instead of jumping the video.
- after clicking subtitle button Space will toggle subtitles
- after clicking settings button Space will toggle settings
- after clicking fullscreen button Space will toggle fullscreen
